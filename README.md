# Mathemagician-Challenge
Back in 2011, Rowan Menezes and I developed this simple game during our 12th grade to understand the concept of object oriented programming in C++. The game is inspired from the traditional 'snake-and-ladder' game. It involves moving on a board based on points scored by quickly solving a mathematical expression. The first player to reach the '25' mark wins.
